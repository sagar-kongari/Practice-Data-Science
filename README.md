## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering
Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning in which the algorithm processes our data and divided them into “clusters”. Clustering algorithms try to find natural clusters in data, the various aspects of how the algorithms to cluster data can be tuned and modified. Clustering is based on the principle that items within the same cluster must be similar to each other. The data is grouped in such a way that related elements are close to each other. Tune parameters to further divide diverse data into smaller groups.

## 📰 Sentiment Analysis using NLTK
Sentiment analysis is the process of classifying whether a block of text is positive, negative, or, neutral. The goal which Sentiment analysis tries to gain is to be analyzed people’s opinions in a way that can help businesses expand. It focuses not only on polarity (positive, negative & neutral) but also on emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.). It uses various Natural Language Processing algorithms such as Rule-based, Automatic, and Hybrid.
